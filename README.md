## Summary

We propose launching an online, vendor‑neutral Community of Practice (CoP) for AI‑empowered practitioners (“AI‑CoP”) who want to explore, share and advance the use of AI in coding, daily task automation, software engineering and ICT architecture. This group will provide a friendly, inclusive space for both deep‑tech experts and broader tech advisors to learn from one another, exchange best practices, co‑create reference implementations, and build skills across both proprietary and open‑source tools. The CoP will be organized around clear personas, a modular topic structure, and hosted on a mix of LinkedIn, Discord, GitHub and a simple website, with governance and art direction to ensure consistency and growth.

## 1. Introduction

AI is rapidly reshaping how we write code, automate infrastructure, generate documentation and design complex systems. Yet practitioners are often siloed by vendor ecosystems, company policies or lack of time to experiment. An open, international CoP will:

- **Democratize access** to hands‑on knowledge of AI tooling—from public LLM APIs to lightweight local models.  
- **Bridge disciplines**, helping architects, DevOps, developers and ICT advisors learn from one another.  
- **Accelerate innovation** by co‑creating reference projects (e.g. Ansible playbooks, frontend‑backend skeletons, RAG pipelines).  
- **Foster trust and security** through shared guidance on data protection, IP considerations and safe LLM usage.

## 2. Name & Abbreviation Ideas

You want the simplicity of “CoP” but with an AI focus that’s distinct from existing Red Hat CoP usage. Possible full names (all yielding the “CoP” abbreviation):

| Full Name                                   | Abbreviation | Notes                                |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Community of Practitioners (CoP‑AI)**      | CoP‑AI       | Simple; clear AI hook                |
| **Collective of Practitioners**              | CoP          | Emphasizes group momentum            |
| **Convergence of Practitioners**             | CoP          | Highlights cross‑disciplinary fusion |
| **Cohort of Practitioners**                  | CoP          | Implies active, iterative learning   |
| **Community of Practice: AI & Automation**   | CoP‑AIA      | Longer, very explicit around AI      |
| **Circle of Practitioners**                  | CoP          | Friendly “roundtable” feel           |

After feedback we can settle on **“Community of Practitioners for AI (CoP‑AI)”** to keep both clarity and brevity.
